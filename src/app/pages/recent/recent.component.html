      The National Vulnerability Intelligence Platform (NVIP) is a new
      generation vulnerability database, a public platform where the software
      development and security communities can obtain rich, actionable
      intelligence about known vulnerabilities. NVIP automates the collection of
      CVEs, providing near real-time publishing of vulnerabilities, as well as
      intelligent analysis and categorization of these vulnerabilities. This
      page provides a summary of the most recent vulnerabilities found by NVIP.
