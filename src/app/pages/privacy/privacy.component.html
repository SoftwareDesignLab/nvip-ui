		<h5>Thank you for visiting the National Vulnerability
			Intelligence Platform (NVIP) project web site. We are committed to

			To better serve our visitors, we use technology to track new and
			returning visitors actions while on the website. These small files
			are commonly referred to as "cookies." Our cookies do not contain any
			personally-identifiable information. Our web measurement applications
			compare the behavior of new and returning visitors in the aggregate
			to help us identify work flows and trends and also resolve common
			problems on our site. Cookies are small files that Web servers place
			on a user's hard drive. They can serve several functions: they allow
			the Web site to identify you as a previous visitor each time you
			access a site; they track what information you view at a site; in the
			more advanced cases they track your movements through many Web sites
			but not the whole Web; businesses use them for customer convenience
			to allow them to produce a list of items to buy and pay for them all
			at one time and to garner information about what individuals are
			buying at their sites; advertisers use them to determine the
			effectiveness of their marketing and offer insights into consumer
			preferences and tastes by collecting data from many Web sites; and
			they can be used to help a Web site tailor screens for each
			customer's preference. We will retain data the technology makes
			available only as long as required by law, or specific program need
			as specified by the National Archives and Records Administration's
			General Records Schedule 20, which pertains to Electronic Records or
			other approved records schedule as applicable. If you are concerned
			about the potential use of the information gathered from your
			computer by cookies, you can set your browser to prompt you before it
			accepts a cookie. You can remove or block the use of web measurement
			and customization technologies by changing the setting of your
